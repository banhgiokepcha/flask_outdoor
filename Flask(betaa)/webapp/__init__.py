"""The create_app() function is the application factory, which takes as an argument the name of 
a configuration to use for the application. The configuration settings stored in one of the classes
defined in config.py can be imported directly into the application using the from_object() method
available in Flaskâ€™s app.config configuration object. The configuration object is selected
by name from the config dictionary. Once an application is created and configured,
the extensions can be initialized. Calling init_app() on the extensions that were created
earlier completes their initialization."""
